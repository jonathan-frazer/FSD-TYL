CSS Box Model

-It aligns your data with specific locations on the webpage
-It is usually measured in Pixels
-There are four levels

outermost - margin
          - border
          - padding
innermost - content

i) Margin
The margin determines it's size outside the content.
This is to push it away from the edges

So the margin value is generally quite high 

ii) Border
The space between the margin and the element.
Generally ranges only between a few pixels

Used for border operations

iii) Padding
The padding takes all the attributes of the background.
It is the distance between the content and the background
Generally we make the padding a bit more so that all our buttons
Don't look little. Even if the text is.

iv) Content
This defines the actual text content that is in our page

We can assign these by using CSS tags
Eg:

form{
    padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px;
    //Order: top right bottom left;
    OR
    //Order: top-bottom right-left;
}
