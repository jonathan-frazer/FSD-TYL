For an application to be considered responsive it should fit it's screen size and UI to fit any screen size

To achieve this we can use CSS parameters
or use a CSS @media 

Measurements we can use for CSS parameters are
font-size:  10px
            10%
            10em
            ...

We generally put more emphasis on the width,
Because the Height can be modified by making it scrollable
But we are locked by the width

To handle this we have:-
-vertical width(vw)
-vertical height(vh)

Eg: font-size: 10vw
               10vh

We use vertical width and height to display large elements
