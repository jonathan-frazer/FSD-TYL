*We started by accessing /admin

*then we did 
python manage.py createsuperuser

It failed, so we had to do
python manage.py migrate

*Then we did
python manage.py createsuperuser

*And we had to enter the following fields
Username (leave blank to use 'mypc'): srxii
Email address: jonat146@gmail.com
Password: ILIkari1@
Password (again): ILIkari1@

*Now we run our server like normal
python manage.py runserver

Now we can log in with our super user and even add more users
