Mongo DB is not inherently supported in django
SO we have to input a different Object Relational Mapping

We will use the library Pymongo, so which is stable.

In Today's class we try out basic DB functions

1> We Start by commenting the default SQL Lite Declaration
2> Create a db_connection.py file in the same folder as your manage.py script

3> We run a DATABASE connection in MongoDB compass

4> Go to Models.py and type in

```
from db_connection import db

# Create your models here
collection = db['data']
```
