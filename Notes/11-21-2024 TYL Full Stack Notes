Today I figured out how to use Session Variables.

They're really neat. They can store information about a session.
You can either use Cookies, Cache or Database to store them.

Cookies: Stay on the Users device, in the form of Cookies
Cache: Stays on the users device as long as page is open
Database: Stays in the Database and is periodically cleared out after(default 2 weeks)

I like Cache, so I'm sticking with that


To set up a session variable you need to go to settings.py
and

SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache' #For Cache
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies' #For Cookies
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db' #For Database
